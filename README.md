# Traveling Salesman Problem Using Classical and SOM-Based Methods
Overview
This practical assignment requires you to: 
• Represent and solve a small instance of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a classical algorithm (e.g., Dynamic Programming, Branch-and-Bound, or Nearest Neighbor). 
• Outline and implement a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) approach to approximate a solution to the same TSP instance. 
• Compare the results (route distance, performance, complexity) between the classical algorithm and the SOM-based approach.
